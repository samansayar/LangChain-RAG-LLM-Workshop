# LangChain, LangSmith, LangGraph, and HuggingFace Learning Path

Welcome to the LangChain-RAG-LLM-Workshop repository! This project is designed to guide you through the exciting world of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the powerful tools that make working with them easier and more efficient.

## Introduction

This workshop is structured as a comprehensive learning path that covers:

1. LangChain: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
2. LangSmith: A platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM applications.
3. LangGraph: A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
4. HuggingFace: A platform that provides access to a wide range of pre-trained models and datasets.

Whether you're new to these technologies or looking to deepen your expertise, this workshop offers hands-on experience and practical knowledge to help you build sophisticated AI-powered applications.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the TASKS.md file for a detailed breakdown of the learning path.
3. Start with the first task and progress through the list at your own pace.
4. Use the provided resources and documentation links to support your learning.

Let's embark on this exciting journey to master LangChain, RAG, and LLMs!
